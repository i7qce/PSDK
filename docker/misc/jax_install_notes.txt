# pip install --upgrade "jax[cpu]"
#
#
# To install jax, did the following:
# For ARM linux on docker in M1 mac, can't install from pip since a pre-built jaxlib isn't provided. Instead need to build from source
#
# Needed to increase docker ram from 7.9 GB to 13 GB, otherwise it crashed when compiling during build
#
# Needed to run the pip install dist/*whl command (the one suggested in the terminal output on completion of build). Then I ran python setup.py install --user in the jax/ directory, don't think that was necessary, just trying things out to get it to work
#
# After successfully building/setting up, importing only worked when inside the jax/ source directory
#
# Previously had an old version of jax that was causing the error- installed jax from pip w/ pip uninstall to remove the old one, and copied the jax/ directory that was in a version-specific jax*.egg directory inside site-packages into site-packages itself
#
# At this point, importing/pip can see it and it seems to work.
